# Rails Assessment

It's time to put our Rails know-how to the test. Today, we have an basic new application.

## Objectives
+ MVC
+ REST
+ Request/Response Cycle
+ Form/Form Helpers
+ ActiveRecord
+ Validations

## Setup

Before you begin, fork and clone this repo, run `rake db:migrate` and `rake db:seed` to get started.

## The Domain

The app you built on Monday is now functioning great. Stephen just has a few extra requests.

## Instructions / Deliverables

1. Initially, Stephen rated the interview with Michael J. Fox a 3, but in retrospect, it actually wasn't that bad! As a user, I should be able to edit an appearance so that I can change a rating. Build out the edit functionality for an appearance, keeping with RESTful conventions.
2. We want to add some more validations to our models - an appearance should only be valid if it has a rating on it that's between 1 and 5.
3. When we create a new appearance, we should also keep track of the producer who booked that appearance. This means that an appearance should also belong to a user. Update your schema, models, and forms to reflect this.   

### Hints / Tips

+ Remember we want to be RESTful. What URL should we use to display our edit form? What action should be responsible for updating the request?
